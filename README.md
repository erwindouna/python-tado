Asynchronous Python client to control Tado devices.

## About

This package allows you to control Tado devices from within Python.
Although it can be used as a standalone package, it is current scope is to be used within Home Assistant.
Not all endpoints and features are fully supported.

## Documentation
A full documentation can be found at [Read the Docs][readthedocs].

## Installation

```bash
pip install tadoasync
```

## Usage

```python
import asyncio

from tadoasync import Tado


async def main() -> None:
    """Example on how to retrieve all devices."""
    async with Tado("username", "password") as tado:
        await tado.get_devices()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

Keep in mind that if you use `async with`, the `aenter` and `aexit` methods are called automatically. It's recommended you use session control, if you don't use `async with`, you need to call `tado.close()` to close the session.

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: Incompatible or major changes.
- `MINOR`: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- `PATCH`: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Usage

As of the 15th of March 2025, Tado has updated their OAuth2 authentication flow. It will now use the device flow, instead of a username/password flow. This means that the user will have to authenticate the device using a browser, and then enter the code that is displayed on the browser into the terminal.

PyTado handles this as following:

1. The `_login_device_flow()` will be invoked at the initialization of a PyTado object. This will start the device flow and will return a URL and a code that the user will have to enter in the browser. The URL can be obtained via the method `device_verification_url()`. Or, when in debug mode, the URL will be printed. Alternatively, you can use the `device_activation_status()` method to check if the device has been activated. It returns three statuses: `NOT_STARTED`, `PENDING`, and `COMPLETED`. Wait to invoke the `device_activation()` method until the status is `PENDING`.

2. Once the URL is obtained, the user will have to enter the code that is displayed on the browser into the terminal. By default, the URL has the `user_code` attached, for the ease of going trough the flow. At this point, run the method `device_activation()`. It will poll every five seconds to see if the flow has been completed. If the flow has been completed, the method will return a token that will be used for all further requests. It will timeout after five minutes.

3. Once the token has been obtained, the user can use the PyTado object to interact with the Tado API. The token will be stored in the `Tado` object, and will be used for all further requests. The token will be refreshed automatically when it expires.
The `device_verification_url()` will be reset to `None` and the `device_activation_status()` will return `COMPLETED`.

## Setting up a development environment

The easiest way to start, is by opening a CodeSpace here on GitHub, or by using
the [Dev Container][devcontainer] feature of Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during development.

You need at least:

- Python 3.12+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]
- NodeJS 18+ (including NPM)

To install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
npm install
poetry install
```

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
